Welcome to the repository for Online Store Apps! This project is in its early stages, and today marks the first day of code. We're working on enhancing the user interface with some cool features.

## Features Added Today (12/30/2023)

### 1. Avatar Icon in Notification and Cart

We've added a stylish avatar icon to the left side and notification and cart icons on the right side. This small but visually appealing feature adds a personal touch to the user interface.

### 2. Search Bar

A search bar field has been incorporated into the app, allowing users to input custom queries based on their preferences. Please note that the search function is not operational at the moment but will be implemented in future updates.

### 3. Products Tab Bar

A products tab bar has been introduced, currently showcasing the product API. In the upcoming iterations, we plan to extend this functionality to include separate tabs for men's and women's products, providing a more comprehensive shopping experience.

### 4. Container Design for Product Display

We've designed a sleek container to showcase the products retrieved from the API. This container enhances the overall visual appeal of the product display.
